Explicit plot matrix, BoxPlot Cases & CasesRel2Pop

Now one can explicitly specify the subplots matrix to plot_what,
instead of letting the internal logic decide based on number of
features and countries being plotted parallely. This helps, if
we want to plot multiple plots for the same feature tag.

TODO: Need to change logic, so that getting required data is
decoupled from the plot logic.

BoxPlot logic updated to plot both cases as well as cases
relative to the population, so that one can compare how each
country is fairing in absolute sense, as well as wrt its own
population.
