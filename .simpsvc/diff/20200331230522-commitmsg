Fixed the issue with Grid not appearing for Single mode

Rather the pyplot's grid func toggles grid display, if no argument
is given. As previously I was not explicitly passing any arg, by
chance the number of calls to plot and inturn grid was such that
it was toggling the grid to off.

Now I have fixed this by explicitly passing True to grid func.
