update default field mapping based on header in csv

Added logic to _load_csv, to optionally try and update the field index 
mapping based on header line in the given csv file.

This is triggered only if the line number (starting with 0) of the csv
header line is given to the function. This requires to be part of the
lines which are skipped at the beginning, before the actual data is 
processed in the file.

eu covid import function updated to use this logic, because it has been
found that eu team has updated the columns/fields in the xlsx file,
by adding some new fields in the middle.
