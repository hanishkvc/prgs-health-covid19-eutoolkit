fill_needed_data function created to avoid reloading

Am assuming the machine where the logic will run will have
enough memory, so filling / extracting all needed data for 
all specified countries into memory and inturn kept in
memory.

The Idea,

For the different plots, if a given country or set of countries 
is being looked at again, then it will use the data which is 
already loaded | filled in memory, instead of extracting it again
from the main | root dictionary(dD).

Inturn the 2nd level dictionary dD2 is returned by this func. 

Also have removed some old subplots calls, which was no longer
being used.
