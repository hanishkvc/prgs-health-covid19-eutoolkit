Cleanup Country Population logic

Renamed some variables to be more self explanatory (tCC3, tYear).

Create a seperate dictionary of 2010 population data.

Identify the latest year for which population data is available,
for each country in the dataset. Later this can be used to
generate the population dictionary of countries with its latest
population info. 

However as dCPLatest would have info for different countries for
different years in this case, we are currently not generated such
a dictionary, as its not easily comparable across countries for
relative studies. So instead 2010 specific population data is
what is used for relative studies. Inturn same is what is printed
instead of all the country population data across years.
