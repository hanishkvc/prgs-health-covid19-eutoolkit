fill_needed_data informative and now used WIP01

Print Country specific data from within fill_needed_data, so
that it is printed for each country only once (bcas, f_n_d
will extract the country specific data only once in a given
run).

plot_what updated to use fill_needed_data.

NOTE: This is a work in progress 1st attempt
