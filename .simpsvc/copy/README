# The Covid data analysis logic

It allows downloading of eu's daily geographic covid data.

Inturn it allows the same to be plotted for a given period
of dates and for a given set of countries, from different 
angles like

  "Cases"           : Number of cases
  "CasesMovAvg"     : Moving average of cases (default 7 days)
  "CasesRelative"   : Cases relative to its Total (specific to each country)
  "CasesMovAvgPlus" : Cases & Moving average of cases
  "CasesLog"        : Cases plotted in log scale
  "CasesCumu"       : Number of cases cumulated over given period
  "CasesDelta"      : Plot delta of cases
  "Death"           : Number of dead
  "DeathMovAvg"     : Moving avg of deaths (default 7 days)
  "DeathCumu"       : Number of deaths cumulated over given period
  "DeathPlus"       : Death and DeatCumu
  "MortalityRate"   : Mortality rate

  "CasesBox"        : Box plot of Cases across all specified countries
  "DeathBox"        : Box plot of Deaths across all specified countries

It also loads population info for each country from a given
set of csv files corresponding to country codes & population

## TODO

Change to using numpy maybe!
